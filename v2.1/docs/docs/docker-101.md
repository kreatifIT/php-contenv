# Docker 101 (Beginner)

New to Docker? Here’s the 5-minute mental model.

## Core concepts

- **Image**: a read-only template (like a VM snapshot). Example: `php:8.4-fpm`.
- **Container**: a running instance of an image. It has processes, filesystems, and a network.
- **Dockerfile**: a recipe to build an image. We use multi-stage Dockerfiles to keep images small.
- **Volume (bind mount)**: share a host folder with a container. Example: `./:/var/www/html`.
- **Port mapping**: expose a container port on your machine. Example: `8081:80` means “host 8081 → container 80”.
- **Network**: containers on the same network can talk by **service name** (e.g., `app` → `mysql`).

## Compose vs Docker

- `docker` runs a single container.
- **`docker compose`** (with a space) runs **multiple services** defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Build args vs environment

- **Build args**: used **while building** the image (compile or include stuff). Example: `PHP_EXT_PDO_MYSQL=true`.
- **Environment**: used **when running** the container (behavior toggles). Example: `XDEBUG_MODE=off`.

> Rule of thumb: “Do I need a tool/extension included in the image?” → build arg. “Do I want to change how it behaves?” → env var.

## How to read commands

- Anything starting with `$` means “run this in your terminal”.
- Lines with YAML go into `docker-compose.yml` (or are generated by `docky`).
